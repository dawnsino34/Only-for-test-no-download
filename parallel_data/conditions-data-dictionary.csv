Closed status refers to condition requirements that have been satisfied, and no further submissions from the company are required; or conditions whose filings or actions apply to a specific phase that have been fulfilled as the phase is completed."
Condition Phase,"As a lifecycle regulator, the CER ensures the safety and protection of the environment throughout all phases of a project. Conditions can apply to one, several or all phases of the lifecycle including: Prior to Construction Phase, During Construction Phase, Includes All Phases of Construction, Post Construction Phase, Not Construction Related, Expiry Date of Regulatory Instrument, Abandonment and Unspecified."
Condition Type,There are two types of conditions: standard and non-standard. A standard condition is typically imposed on all approved projects. Non-standard conditions capture project-specific information or concerns that are not addressed by standard conditions.
Condition Filing,"A document that demonstrates the fulfillment of a condition’s requirements. Filing Required means a company must file a document with the CER in order to comply with a condition. The CER reviews these filings. Filing Not Required means a company is not required to file a document with the CER in order to comply with a condition. Some conditions are covered by filings for another related condition. If a condition does not require a company to file a document, the CER can verify compliance during a compliance verification activity (CVA) such as an inspection or audit."
